Development for Chrome extension that allows users to make nested tab groups.

# Privacy Policy

## Intro

This privacy policy contains the how this extension (the MoreGroups extension) collects and handles personal data.

## Data Collection

This extension does not collect any data. Therefore, no data will be or can be sold to third parties. With this being said, there is one way your data is used.

## Chrome Storage API

This extension uses [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developers.chrome.com/extensions/storage) to locally store group titles, group ids, group colors, and tab URLs. However, this extension does not transmit any of this information and only accesses it locally on your machine.

## Changes to the Privacy Policy

If there are any major changes made to this privacy policy, I will push a new version and ask you to agree to the changed privacy policy.

## Feedback

If you happen to have any questions or concerns, feel free to [send me an email](mailto:garrettrussell111@gmail.com) or create an issue in this repository.

By major, I mean that users will not be notified for changes to fix grammar, typos, or other errors of a similar magnitude.
